The foot of wire you've received has a theoritical resistance of:
Since our goal is consistancy, don't bother calculating it yourself.

## Program Information
In the C# program you will notice a spreadsheet - this is where you should
enter your data. The labels should be pretty self explanitory.
Don't click on the upload button until you have all the data in filled in
the spreadsheet. This uploads ALL the data to the database with the correct
labels and such. Also, the group ID is your groups letter assigned by West.
For example, I'm group J.
Lastly, the "4-wire" button will run an automated 4-wire resistance and 
place the values in their cells on the spreadsheet.
After you've ran the automation and collected all the manual data, click on 
the upload button. This will put everything into the database with the 
correct labeling. This prevents idiots like Jon Covert and I from doing it 
wrong. Also notice that you don't have to do the average either. Congrats.
